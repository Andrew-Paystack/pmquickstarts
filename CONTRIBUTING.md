### Before you contribute

Review the [`README.md`](./README.md).

### Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose.

We also use [Vale](https://vale.sh/) for prose linting. When you submit a pull request, Vale automatically checks your content for spelling and other errors. If the job fails, correct any errors in your content and push a new commit to re-run the job. If there are false positives, add a comment to your pull request and we will review.

### Code of conduct
